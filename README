CONFIGURE
---------

ScaLAPACK is required. ELPA is optional (it has to be compiled manually, 
the flag -D__ELPA has to be specified).

Under "makes/" there are several Makefiles, all related to Darwin (HPCS)


INPUT FILE FORMAT
-----------------

- "GEN-MAT" is the size of the matrix 
- "NROOTS" is the number of eigen-state to compute, starting from index 1.
- "DIAGONALIZER" is the type of solver to use. 
	PDSYEVD (default), PDSYEVX, ELPA-1STAGE, ELPA-2STAGE

NOTE: if PDSYEVD, NROOTS is ignored (by default all the eigen-values and 
      eigen-vectors are computed)

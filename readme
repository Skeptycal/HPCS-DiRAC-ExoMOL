1. To change the dimension of the matrix edit the following line in the input file gen_n_NN.inp
GEN-MAT "NN"
by modifying "NN" to the dimension required. The text in brackets can be used for comments. 
2. To submit the diagonalization job on DARWIN using our 2-step submission scripts use
./b_diag.sh gen_n_100.inp 24 36 
where gen_n_100.inp is the input file, 24 is the number of nodes (16 processors per node on Darwin) 
and 36 is the wall-time in hours. Please also modify the project name in following submission line 
sbatch -A DIRAC-dp020 ....
3. To estimate the memory usage and the number of nodes use PDSYEV_estimate_memory_DARWIN.xlsx, where 
adjust the number of nodes for the "Total" memtory be smaller than 4 Gb.
